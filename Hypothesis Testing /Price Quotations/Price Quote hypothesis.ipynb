    "# Price Quote hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The business problem involves a small manufacturing company aiming to enhance its price quoting process, which is currently labor-intensive and highly variable. The sales department manager is concerned about the complexity and potential inconsistency in the quoted prices, which depend on various factors. To address this issue, an improvement team conducted a study with two experts, Mary and Barry, independently providing prices for twelve orders. The goal is to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the average price quotes provided by Mary and Barry. This analysis will help the company understand the extent of variability between pricing experts and may lead to process improvements to achieve more consistent and accurate pricing."
