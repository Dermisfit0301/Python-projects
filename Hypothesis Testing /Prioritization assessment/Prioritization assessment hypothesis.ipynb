    "# Prioritization assessment hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "ApDudes, a tablet application developer, faced challenges with project deadlines as only 10% of their projects were completed on time and within budget. To address this, the project manager focused on the implementation phase and identified that software engineers struggled with task prioritization and project size. To improve the situation, they implemented a classification and prioritization system, breaking projects into smaller tasks with assigned priorities. The belief was that this approach would accelerate the completion of high-priority tasks, ultimately reducing overall project completion times. The effectiveness of this system is under evaluation to ensure that higher-priority tasks are completed more quickly, contributing to improved project timelines."
